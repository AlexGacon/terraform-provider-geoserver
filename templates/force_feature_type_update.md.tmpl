  A solution to trigger a feature type when working without explicit attributes
---

# The problem

When you declare featuretype resource into your terraform module and you don't explicitely declare the attributes available in your feature type, the GeoServer resource won't be updated if the underlying data structure is changed.

# The solution

The solution to manage is the following:
- Declare a input variable to be able to provide some version information into terraform
- Use a `terraform_data` resource to track into the terraform state how the version evolves over time
- Add a trigger on the related resources to update them when the version changes

Let's see an example on how to configure this.

## Input variable declaration

Just declare a standard terraform variable to inject into your terraform manifest a version information.

{{ tffile "examples/force_feature_type_update_variable.tf" }}

You can provide the value of the variable like you want: default value change, using prompt, variable injection...

## Track the version changes into terraform

We need now to be able to track when the version changes in order to trigger things into terraform.

For that we will use a `terraform_data` resource (available since `v1.4`), which can store values which need to be followed.

{{ tffile "examples/force_feature_type_update_tf_data.tf" }}

## Trigger other resource update on version change

The last part of the solution is to defined on each resource you want to update upon database changes a replace trigger.

It can be done like this:

{{ tffile "examples/force_feature_type_update_trigger.tf" }}
